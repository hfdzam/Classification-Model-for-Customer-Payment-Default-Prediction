# Classification Model for Customer Payment Default Prediction

## Notebook Purpose

This notebook aims to build a classification model to predict customers who are likely to default on their payments next month.

## Overview

In this notebook, you will:
1. Explore and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train different classification models.
3. Evaluate the performance of the models.
4. Select the best-performing model for prediction.
